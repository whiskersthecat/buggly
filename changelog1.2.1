Bugglyio 1.2.1

- Fixed: cards being purchased for the incorrect amounts after respawning
- Fixed: respawn screen text alignment, and correctly choosing cards to respawn with
- Player move speed is now determined by actual framerate, so lag won't slow down the player.
- Players will now respawn even farther away from other players
- Sound fx for Beam

- You can now use the number keys u, i, o and p to play your cards. Each key plays the first card in your hand with a specific color.

BALANCE CHANGES
- Beam damage halved
